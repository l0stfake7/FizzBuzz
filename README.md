# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz in every programming language, inspired by [hello-world](https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world)

I added a file text.txt, containing the expected output, partly as a joke on the filenaming convention used in this repo.
Also as a useful tool to compare program output, I noticed there is some old code I wrote that needs to be patched.
Hopefully it will also be useful for building in some sort of continuous integration testing.

Hopefully I can include a list of other similar projects here.
